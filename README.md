## ðŸ”¥ Features:  
âœ… **Random Number Generation** â€“ A new number is generated each time the game starts.  
âœ… **User Input & Validation** â€“ Ensures the user enters a valid number between 1 and 100.  
âœ… **Hint System** â€“ Provides hints if the guess is close to the correct number.  
âœ… **Attempts Tracking** â€“ Displays the number of attempts taken to guess the number.  
âœ… **Best Score System** â€“ Saves the lowest number of attempts using `localStorage`.  
âœ… **Reset Functionality** â€“ Allows users to restart the game without refreshing the page.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works:  
1. The game generates a **random number** between 1 and 100.  
2. The user enters a guess and clicks **"Submit Guess"**.  
3. The game provides feedback:  
   - "Guess a larger number" if the guess is too low.  
   - "Guess a smaller number" if the guess is too high.  
   - "You're very close!" if the guess is within 5 numbers.  
   - "ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!" if the guess is correct.  
4. The game tracks **attempts** and updates the **best score** if a new record is achieved.  
5. Once the user guesses correctly, the **input and button are disabled**, and a **"Play Again"** button appears.  

## ðŸŽ® Technologies Used:  
- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the game.  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Game logic, number validation, hints, and score tracking.  

This is a fun and interactive way to test your guessing skills while improving logic and problem-solving. ðŸš€
